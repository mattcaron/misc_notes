# Disposition of games by system

**Note**: This just applies to classic games. Modern games (Steam, etc.) are run on the laptop or, if it isn't powerful enough, my desktop.

## MiSTer

### Contents

Anything that is supported including, but not limited to:

- Apple II
- 486
    - This is experimental, we'll see how well it works. If it works well, Dosbian might be redundant.
- NES
- SNES
- Genesis
- NeoGeo
- Various Arcade cores

### Rationale

1. For the arcade cores - faithful reproduction of the above on original

### Notes

I only copied over the ROMS for which cores exist (because directories exist for them). As more cores drop, I'll copy over more ROMs when the update script makes the directories.

## RetroPi

### Contents

Emulation of any of the consoles / arcade systems not supported by the above:

- N64
- Playstations
- MAME stuff

### Rationale

I want a faithful reproduction, but MiSTer doesn't (can't?) do those things yet. This is the stopgap.

### Notes

I will put all the ROMs I have on this system, so we can do a Pepsi challenge with the emulators, or to test functionality in case someone else needs help building such box.

## Dosbian



### Contents

### Rationale

## ScummVM

I'm not sure where to put this yet - it likely mostly depends on just how much space the other builds have free once complete.

## Laptop

### Contents

Everything else.

### Rationale

Anything not covered above is run on Linux under emulation, as they are designed to be run under a real OS and whatnot.
