From a clean Xubuntu 14.04 install, minimal install CD (mini.iso).

1.) Base install

Boot the install cd and follow instructions to do the base
install. Make sure to select "Download updates while installing" and
"install third party software".

Set up machine as desired. Fairly self-explanatory. Partitioning
should be roughly as follows, adjusted for available disk size as
appropriate (including for RAID). Disk labels should be representative
of the mount point. Manual partitioning is likely required.

Pysical Partitions (on both drives):
1	1GB	Physical volume for RAID -> ext4 -> /boot

2	Rest	physical volume for RAID -> physical volume for
                encryption, containing a single LVM partition.

For the RAID you want the above physical partition scheme across all
drives, with each one set up for "Physical volume for RAID". Then you
create MD devices for each pairing (same partition on each drive) and
then define it to be whatever filesystem you want, and continue on as
normal from there.

IMPORTANT: If upgrading the installer NOW WILL ACTIVATE ENCRYPTED
VOLUMES, which is nice, because before it would just delete them.

- These should represent MINIMUM sizes, and is sized for 500GB
  HDD's. More is often better.

LVM Partitions
swap		Amount of RAM + a bit[1]
tmp		10GB	/tmp
var		10GB	/var
root		20GB	/
home		Rest	/home

[1] This is mainly important for machines where you want to
hibernate. You need at least as much swap space as you have RAM, so do
that plus a bit. Old standard is 2 * RAM, which is plenty, but is a
bit overkill with modern machines. On the other hand, if you never do
a full hibernate (because it just takes too long to read back 16GB of
RAM from disk), set it to something reasonable. Swap kind of sucks
anyway..

(For some machines, a common area of /pub, or /shared, might be
appropriate, and should be taken out of /home)

Once all that is done, you'll get the "Choose software to install"
screen, where you should choose "Xubuntu desktop" and let it install
(we'll install everything else later)

IMPORTANT: If your grub-install fails, chances are you came up with an
invalid partitioning scheme. Go back to the partitioning menu and
ensure that you set your /boot partition to a non-encrypted non-LVM
parition which doesn't use a RAID greater than 1 (if any). That is
likely the culprit (otherwise, you'll spend 3 hours trying to manually
install grub only to realize that the partition which is supposed to
contain boot info is empty).

## NOTE: All this stuff assumes that you're root, such as with "sudo -s"

2.) Install useful base things

sudo apt-get install emacs synaptic

3.) After machine is up, run synaptic, go to settings->repositories
make sure the following are enabled:

- main
- universe
- restricted
- multiverse
- source code

Select other software tab and enable/add:
- partner
- partner (Source Code)
- independent
- independent (Source code)

Select updates tab and enable:
- trusty-security
- trusty-updates
- trusty-backports

(or just grab sources.list from some reasonable machine)

4.) Do:
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade

5.) Install things:

seem to have been removed:

ia32-libs (but libc6-i386 seems to be there, so it may be okay)
usb-imagewriter
acroread
hpodder

6.) Set up static IP's (for machines with them)
- edit /etc/network/interfaces, and add lines like:
auto iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.9.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.9.254

ifdown eth0
ifup eth0

- and set the DNS server in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base

- Then restart it:

sudo service resolvconf restart

7.) Make ssh work:
## For an old machine, use the old keys - you did save /etc, didn't you?

## For a new machine, use the new keys generated by the distro.

- make sure to add to the firewall
ufw allow ssh

- In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, set:
- PermitRootLogin no

- once you've set up public key auth, turn off password access. edit
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and set
    PasswordAuthentication no

service ssh restart

8.) Turn on the firewall.

ufw enable

9.) Fix cron - add the following to the top of personal crontab:

MAILTO="matt@mattcaron.net"

10.) Install dvd decoder

echo "deb http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libdvdcss.list
echo "deb-src http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libdvdcss.list
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libdvdcss.list
wget -O - http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/videolan-apt.asc|sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2

11.) latex
    cd /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex
    cp -a ~/system_stuff/latex/local .
    chown -R root:root local
    cp -a ~/system_stuff/latex/fonts/cookingsymbols.tfm /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/.
    mkdir -p /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/public/
    chmod a+rx /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/public/
    cp -a ~/system_stuff/latex/fonts/cookingsymbols.mf /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/public/.
- then run texconfig and select "rehash"
- Also, set the paper to US

12.) ntpd (for fixed machines only, for mobile, the default is fine)

## for server, make sure to add to ufw
ufw allow ntp

## for client
- edit /etc/ntpd.conf and comment out the line:
server ntp.ubuntu.com
- and add the line:
server router

13.) cups
- sudo system-config-printer
- add printers as appropriate
- For servers, under Server->Settings, select:
    Publish shared printers conected to this system
- make sure to enable it in the ufw
    sudo ufw allow ipp

14.) Set up samba:

- Servers
    cd /etc/samba
    mv smb.conf smb.conf.old
    cp ~/system_stuff/samba/smb.conf.`hostname` ./smb.conf
    update-rc.d smbd defaults
    update-rc.d nmbd defaults
    service smbd start
    service nmbd start

- make sure to add ufw rules for it
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-ns
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-dgm
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-ssn
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port microsoft-ds

- Other machines
  - Remember to turn it off on places you don't want it.
    echo "manual" >> /etc/init/smbd.override
    echo "manual" >> /etc/init/nmbd.override
    service smbd stop
    service nmbd stop

15.) Set up ssmtp
    cd /etc/ssmtp
    mv ssmtp.conf ssmtp.conf.old
    cp ~/system_stuff/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf .
    chmod a+r ssmtp.conf

16.) Set up apache (if applicable)

- see install.apache

17.) Set up video editing:

- Add user to video group so I can capture video
sudo usermod -a -G video matt

18.) Set up sensors (if not set up automagically) for case

- For case / Gigabyte X48-DQ6 board
- add the following to /etc/modules:
it87
coretemp

- For hiro / Thinkpad T530:
- add the following to /etc/modules:
coretemp

(For new machines, this is accomplished by running sensors-detect and
following prompts - the defaults are typically fine.)

# FIXME - edit the conf file to fix scaling, etc.

19.) Add temperature monitoring script to crontab (servers only):

@hourly              /home/matt/bin/tempChecker

20.) Set up logcheck
- edit /etc/cron.d/logcheck and set it to @daily and not every 2 hours

21.) Install d stuff:

apt-get install gdc-4.8 libphobos-4.8-dev libsqlite3-dev

22.) Install qbrew build dependencies:

apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev qt4-designer

23.) Add necessary users to the vboxusers group, ie:

sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers matt

24.) In fixed systems, remove network-manager

sudo apt-get remove network-manager

25.) Proprietary drivers (optional, for systems with ATI cards)

sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates

26.) Pulseaudio equalizer:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-equalizer

27.) Add Steam:

echo "deb http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/ precise steam" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/steam.list
chmod a+r /etc/apt/sources.list.d/steam.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys F24AEA9FB05498B7

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install steam

28.) Add GetDeb games repo (PlayDeb)
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu lucid-getdeb games"
wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -

29.) Add gcdemu

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cdemu/ppa 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcdemu

30.) symlink quake data to where it expects it.
cd /usr/share/games/quake/
sudo ln -s ~/dosbox/games/quake/id1 .

31.) symlink rott data where it expects it
cd /usr/share/games/
sudo ln -s ~/dosbox/games/rott .

also, fix the default symlink:

sudo update-alternatives --set rott /usr/games/rott-commercial

32.) Add firewall exception for iperf

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port 5001

33.) Allow firewall exception for ktorrent:

sudo ufw allow 6881
sudo ufw allow 8881

34.) Make java pretty

-  Edit /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/swing.properties
   and uncomment:

swing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel

35.) Install epson scanner driver

Download the .deb packages from their website.

- it depends on xsltproc, so install that:

sudo apt-get install xsltproc

- It also depends on sane, but we installed that as a dependency of
  xsane during base system setup.

- and then install the packages:

sudo dpkg -i iscan_2.29.3-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_amd64.deb iscan-data_1.26.0-1_all.deb iscan-network-nt_1.1.1-1_amd64.deb

- Edit the /etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf file and add:

net EPSON632112.home

- because that's the printer.

- The documentation says to comment out `epson2` in
  /etc/sane.d/dll.conf, but I didn't need to do that.

- This adds an `iscan` app which will find the printer on the network
  and try to use it, or you can just use xsane....

36.) Stop the stupid GNOME SSH agent thing from working.

NOTE: This is a stupid hack to get around the fact that, apparently,
the gnome keyring is started unconditionally with all components if
any gnome services are run (and we would like to run them, just not
this specific one).

To fix, do:

cd /usr/bin
sudo mv gnome-keyring-daemon gnome-keyring-daemon-wrapped

Then create a new gnome-keyring-daemon and set its contents to:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon-wrapped --components=pkcs11,secrets,gpg "$@"

and make it executable:

sudo chmod a+rx /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon

37.) Fix systemd from taking over power events (XFce has a fine power
manager - let it do the work):

- edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and add the following to the end:

HandlePowerKey=ignore
HandleSuspendKey=ignore
HandleHibernateKey=ignore
HandleLidSwitch=ignore

- Since systemd is like the new init, a reboot is likely required to
  make this change active (not sure if there is a daemon you can HUP
  or not, I gave up looking after about 2 seconds)

38.) Replace the new-but-doesn't-work-quite-right lightlocker with
xscreensaver.

(Ref:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-power-manager/+bug/1303736)

sudo apt-get install xscreensaver
sudo apt-get remove light-locker

(configure with xscreensaver-demo)

39.) Install go-mtpfs

- Ref:
https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs

- Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install golang-go libusb-1.0-0-dev

- Instructions:

mkdir ~/workspace/code/go-mtpfs
export GOPATH=~/workspace/code/go-mtpfs
go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs

- The binary is in ~/workspace/code/go-mtpfs/bin. Clever.

- Link in place:

cd ~/bin/
ln -s ~/workspace/code/go-mtpfs/bin/go-mtpfs .

- Add required users to fuse group, e.g.:
sudo usermod -a -G matt fuse

(log off and log back in)

Now, this makes it all work, but, of course, rsync fails with messages like:

2014/05/31 10:00:48 2070822 bytes in 256.459887ms: 8 mb/s
2014/05/31 10:00:48 basenameRename failed: RetCode 1

Which I suspect is a problem because of the following from the README:

CAVEATS

* It does not implement rename between directories, because the
  Android stack does not implement it.

As such, --inplace needs to be specified to rsync when going over an
MTP interface.
