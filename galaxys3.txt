Verizon SPH-I535 (Galaxy S III) and SCH-I605 (Note 2) 4.3 Android Version

Dial ##DMMODE#
Tap On
(Remember after flashing to return and Tap OFF) 

== Flashing to Page Plus ==

Note1: This takes 2 flashes, but they only charge you for 1 (because
       it's one phone).
Note2: Make sure to scroll down to the FULL FLASH instructions, and
       not do the half flash. The instructions are different.

 1. Remove the SIM card
 2. Sign up for Wireless Workshop
 3. Buy some credit (minimum $50)
 4. Install Wireless Workshop
 5. Install the Samsung ADB Drivers (if not already installed
    previously)
 6. Enable Diagnostic Mode (see above)
 7. Enable Developer Options (see above)
 8. Enable USB Debugging in developer options
 9. In the stock messaging app, bring up the menu -> settings, and
    disable notifications.
10. Fire up Wireless Workshop
11. Select the phone, to from, etc on the Flashing tab
12. If the phone asks, allow USB debugging (likely already done when
    rooting)
13. Click "Refresh"
14. Under "Connect", Select SAMSUNG Mobile USB Serial Port"
15. Click "Open Port"
16. Go to Page Plus (or a dealer) and have them change the existing
    MEID for your number to the new MEID (retrieved from the phone). I
    used PagePlusDirect and paid the $5 because they answered some
    questions for me, and I'd feel like a dick if I used their time and
    didn't use at least one of their services. Plus, I hate talking
    with people on the phone and this is fully automated.

    Results:
     MDN = My phone number
     MIN = You should be able to get this from the old phone - if not,
           ask. It's unique to your number, like the phone number, but
           it's not always the same. As the phone number moves, so
           does the MIN.
     SID list = I chose 78, which is Albany/Schenectady/Troy 
     	 (Chosen from http://www.pageplusdirect.com/sidlist.html)

17. Click "Provision"
18. Click "Flash"
19. Let the phone reboot
20. It will report failure to calculate 3G stuff, but that's okay - it
    needs to be flashed twice, remember?
21. Click "Open Port"
22. Click "Flash" again
23. Let the phone reboot again.
24. Put the SIM card back in (I'm not sure if this is necessary, but it
     at least makes the annoying messages go away)
