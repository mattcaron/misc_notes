This is a "bottom up" description.

1.) Printer

mUVe3D 1.5 w/ Flex Vat and Uber-Z upgrade.

http://www.muve3d.net/press/product/muve-1-dlp/

Documentation:

Support forums:

Full setup documentation for the below software:

2.) Arduino

Need to install arduino to work on or upload printer firmware.

The version in the repos is old. Download latest from
https://www.arduino.cc

3.) Control module:

Raspberry Pi 2:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/

(Buy it from amazon).

4.) Needs Raspbian Lite installed:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Basically, just untar it and dd it into the SD card, e.g:

sudo dd bs=4M if=2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

5.) Printer/projector control software:

NanoDLP

Note that this takes SVGs generated by the slicing software (Slic3r).

http://www.nanodlp.com/

This gets installed on top of Rasbpian. which was installed above,
according to the documentation contained under item 1.

In addition to those instructions:

 0. default login is pi/raspberry
 1. edit /etc/hostname and set the hostname to muve3d
 2. run:
        sudo raspi-config 
    and set up all the localization, keyboard, etc.
    Also, expand file system.
 3. as pi, change the password to something random (we'll add a user later)

Let it reboot, log in as pi, then fix up users.

 1. Add me:
    sudo adduser matt
    sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi matt

 2. Make sure to copy over my pub key into authorized_keys.

 3. Log out as pi, log in as me, then lock pi.

    sudo usermod -L pi

 4. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  a. Set "PermitRootLogin" to no
  b. Set "PasswordAuthentication" to no

 5. Install upgrades

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

 6. Add some useful things:

    sudo apt-get install emacs git

Reboot again, then proceed on and install all the NanoDLP bits per the
instructions.. more or less. However, we need to do it as pi, not as me:

sudo -u pi -i

(and then do the install process). The TL:DR and update is:

sudo killall pigpiod
(wget http://www.nanodlp.com/nanodlp.tar.gz -O - | \
tar -C /home/pi -xz) && cd /home/pi/printer && sudo ./setup.sh

(the answers are:
Do you want to optimize Raspberry Pi settings for nanoDLP automatically? [Y/n] Y
Do you see black border around display output? (disable overscan) [Y/n] Y
Do you want to enable i2c to enable communication with LCD and other hardware with i2c connectivity? [Y/n] n
Do you want to add nanoDLP to startup by replacing rc.local? [Y/n] y
To expand file system and enable camera module you need to use raspi-config. Do you want to use it now? [Y/n] n

Once it's installed, go to:

http://muve3d/printer/distro/change

and click "change to mUVe3D version"

Once that's done, go to:

http://muve3d

 1. Click setup. On the "Hardware Setup" tab.
  a. Set Printer Name to "mUVe3D"
  b. Change "Shutter" to "Disabled"
 2. Click Password Protection
  a. add user "muve3d" and generic password
 3. Go into printer profiles and add as necessary.

6.) Slicing software:

Slic3r.

Used to slice for beta RPi2 controller w/ NanoDLP.

http://slic3r.org/download

7.) STL part orientation and support generation:

MeshMixer:

http://www.meshmixer.com/linux.html

To use to generate supports and optimal positioning:

  1. Click Import
  2. Open your file.
  3. Click "print".
  4. Click the little toolbox icon next to "Add Supports"
  5. On the "overhangs" menu, select "SLA/DLP Printer", then modify
     the settings as follows (anything not mentioned stays the same)

     a. Angle Thresh: 10.43
     b. Max Angle: 70 (pulled all the way right)
     c. Density: 1
     d. Post Diameter: 1.023
     e. Tip Diameter: 0.068
     (these values are taken from:
      https://groups.google.com/d/msg/muve-3d-support-group/7xXU_pZj59A/x7Mn8Uy0CgAJ
      thanks to Ryan LaBarre for finding them)

  6. Click "Optimize Orientation"
  7. Click "Generate Support"
  8. Do File->Save Scene as
  9. Save it (make sure to add the ".mix" suffix).
 10. Close MeshMixer
 11. Open MeshMixer
 12. Open the file you saved in step 9.
 13. Export it to .stl ASCII

You can then open this in Creation Workshop, orient and print it.

The reason for the goofy two step is that, once you're in the support
generation section, it likes to crash if you back out of it.

=== everything below this line outside of the standard workflow ==

1.) STL validator / fixer / etc.

meshlab

in repos or from http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/

The important things here are apparently:
  Render -> Show Non Manif Edges
  Render -> Show Non Manif Vertices

2.) OpenSCAD - programmer's CAD program

In repos, or from:

    http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html

which includes a PPA.
