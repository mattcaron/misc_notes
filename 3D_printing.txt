This is a "bottom up" description.

1.) Printer

http://www.muve3d.net/press/product/muve-1-dlp/

version 1.5 w/ Flex Vat.

2.) Printer/projector control software:

http://www.envisionlabs.net/

Note that this can generate support structures.

3.) STL validator / fixer / etc.

meshlab 

in repos or from http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/

The important things here are apparently:
  Render -> Show Non Manif Edges
  Render -> Show Non Manif Vertices

4.) OpenSCAD - programmer's CAD program

In repos, or from:

    http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html

which includes a PPA.

OpenSCAD tutorial:

Using it with an external editor:

Emacs Mode:

5.) Arduino 

Need to install arduino to work on printer firmware.

The version in the repos is old. Download latest from 
https://www.arduino.cc

6.) MeshMixer: http://www.meshmixer.com/linux.html

To use to generate supports and optimal positioning:

  1. Click Import
  2. Open your file.
  3. Click "print".
  4. Click the little toolbox icon next to "Add Supports"
  5. On the "overhangs" menu, select "SLA/DLP Printer"
  6. Click "Optimize Orientation"
  7. Click "Generate Support"
  8. Do File->Save Scene as
  9. Save it
 10. Close MeshMixer
 11. Open MeshMixer
 12. Open the file you saved in step 9.
 13. Export it to .stl ASCII

You can then open this in Creation Workshop, orient and print it.

The reason for the goofy two step is that, once you're in the support
generation section, it likes to crash if you back out of it.
