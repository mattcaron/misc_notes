Note: This is half a document. I never did finish getting this set up
and the world has moved on - I'm likely better using any of the many
photogrammetery apps available these days and having the camera move
around the platform (or just reuse it and have the platform move as
this does, if it supports that - which would be easier). Still
committed for posterity.

1.) Install Horus:

Docs here:
http://horus.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.2/source/installation/ubuntu.html

At the time of writing, this does not work, because of package
conflicts. See:

https://github.com/bqlabs/horus/issues/92

* Docker and a helpful fellow to the rescue:

sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

* log off and log back in

docker pull fcrohas/horus

* Make a simple wrapper script:

====
#!/bin/bash
xhost +local:`docker inspect --format='{{ .Config.Hostname }}' $containerId`
docker run -it --rm \
    --name horus \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    --device=/dev/video1:/dev/video1:rwm \
    --device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0:rwm \
    -v ~/workspace/horus-docker/horus:/root/.horus \
    fcrohas/horus:latest
xhost -
====

* Make sure the user (me) is in the dialout group (I should already, but
  make sure):

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

* Log off and log back in


2.) Calibrate

* Start it the first time. It will pop up a wizard wondow. Tick the
  box that says to not show it again, then close it.

* Follow the instructions to upload firmware.
