I.) Base install and configs:

1.) Install Ubuntu server as normal from an Ubuntu install CD.

Partition as follows:

Disks 1 and 2:

- BOS compat boot partition (grub_bios) - 100MB
/boot - 1GB (physical RAID)
- rest (physical RAID)
  - Make this RAID LVM, partitioned as follows:
    / - 500GB
    /tmp - 50GB
    /var - 100GB
    swap - 4GB
    /home - rest

Disks 3 and 4:
- whole disk (physical RAID)
  - Make this RAID LVM, partitioned as follows:
    /mnt/time_machine - 2TB
    /mnt/dlna - 1TB

When it asks for what to install, select OpenSSH server and leave
everything else blank.

2.) Set up networking:

- edit /etc/network/interfaces, and add lines like:
auto iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.9.51
        netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.9.254

ifdown eth0
ifup eth0

- and set the DNS server in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base

- Then restart it:

sudo service resolvconf restart

3.) Install Amahi (base install):

From: http://docs.amahi.org/ubuntu-12.html

- Do:
    wget http://u12.amahi.org/install-amahi
    sh install-amahi

- Enter sudo password when asked.

-  Reboot when asked

4.) Bootstrap install of useful things:

sudo apt-get install synaptic

5.) After machine is up, run synaptic, go to settings->repositories
make sure the following are enabled:

- main
- universe
- restricted
- multiverse
- source code

Select other software tab and enable/add:
- partner
- partner (Source Code)
- independent
- independent (Source code)

Select updates tab and enable:
- precise-security
- precise-updates
- precise-backports

(or just grab sources.list from some reasonable machine)

Select Statistics and enable:
- submit statistical information

6.) Do:
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade

7.) Install more useful things
sudo apt-get install tree unison atop texlive-binaries hpodder \
system-config-printer-gnome cups synaptic brother-cups-wrapper-laser nmap \
emacs wireshark lm-sensors ntp ssmtp logcheck wakeonlan gdisk git-core gitk \
iftop mailutils

8.) Change DNS from OpenDNS to the router, which will pass queries up
    to the ISP:

sudo​hda-change-dns 192.168.9.254 192.168.9.254

9.) Fix up apache:

- edit /etc/apache2/ports.conf and comment out:

 NameVirtualHost *:80

(it is defined elsewhere)

- disable the default site

sudo a2dissite default

- make a compat symlink

- Apparently, it used to be in /etc/httpd, and now it's in
  /usr/share/hdactl/httpd, so:

sudo rm -r /usr/share/hdactl/httpd
sudo ln -s /etc/httpd/conf.d /usr/share/hdactl/httpd

- But we don't want it to get doubly-included, so edit
  /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and comment out:

 Include /usr/share/hdactl/httpd/

Also, envvars is wrong, so edit /etc/apache2/envvars and set:

export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data

10.) Enable HTTPS

From: https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Access_HDA_over_SSL

- Make a selfsigned cert (see sslcerts), so you end up with crt and
  key on the amahi server

- Move things where Amahi expects them:

sudo mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl.key /etc/httpd/ssl.crt
sudo mv crt /etc/httpd/ssl.crt/server.crt
sudo mv key /etc/httpd/ssl.key/server.key
sudo chmod 400 /etc/httpd/ssl.key/server.key

- Add vhosts on 443:

echo 'NameVirtualHost *:443' | sudo tee -a /etc/httpd/conf.d/00-init.conf > /dev/null

- Add config:

sudo cp /etc/httpd/conf.d/01-platform.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/01-platform-ssl.conf

- Edit 01-platform-ssl.conf and change "<Virtualhost *:80>" to:

<VirtualHost *:443>
   SSLEngine on
   SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL
   SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl.crt/server.crt
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl.key/server.key

- Change the rewrite rules at the bottom of the rewrite rules in
  01-platform.conf

RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 [R,L]

- restart:

sudo service apache2 restart

11.) Turn on advanced settings:

Settings->Global Settings

Tick "Advanced settings"

12.) Advanced network customization:
See:
https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Network_customizations

Create /etc/hdactl.conf and put in:

$DYN_LO="100";
$DYN_HI="240";

sudo service hdactl stop
sudo service hdactl start

(everything below 150 is static, as is everything 240 and above)

13.) Add a pile of machines:

mysql -u amahihda hda_production -pAmahiHDARulez

- then add the machines:

INSERT INTO hosts (host,mac,address) VALUES
 ("brother-hl5250dn","00:80:77:E5:9B:E6",112),
 ("dell3000","08:00:37:32:08:75",111),
 ("bridge-office","00:0F:66:0A:96:23",253),
 ("bridge-bedroom","68:7F:74:1B:79:F6",252),
 ("bridge-garage","00:12:17:ba:54:3f",251),
 ("router","A0:F3:C1:E4:B6:2E",254);

(Note that there are *way* fewer machines with Static IPs, because,
with Amahi, we don't need them put in just to add them to DNS - it
allows sending of host names and auto-updating of DNS. So, everything
here is actually static, or things which are too stupid to know their
own name, but we actually want to get to (ie, printers). Also, we
*could* have given them aliases, but then the WOL button wouldn't
work.)

- once that's done, go to Setup->Networking->Static IPs and add case:

case 1 00:1d:7d:07:d3:25

- (that will force it to blow all the machines out to the config files)

14.) Add an alias for "amahi":

Networking->Aliases

Add amahi at 51

15.) Add accounts:

Setup->Users

liz (and make admin)

16.) Disable greyhole (we don't use it)

Setup->Servers->Greyhole, and disable all of it.

- And, of course, that doesn't persist, so actually remove it:

echo "manual" >> /etc/init/greyhole.override
sudo service greyhole stop

- And, of course, that doesn't stop the greyhole cron job, so edit
  /etc/cron.daily/grehole and comment it out

17.) Set up shares:

Setup->Shares

- Delete everything that's there (they're in the wrong spot, we don't
  care, etc.)

18.) Fix samba workgroup:

- Patch /var/hda/platform/html/app/models/share.rb
- In the function self.header_workgroup, right after:
		"\tpreferred master = yes",
- add:
		"\tlocal master = yes",

- Then fix the workgroup:

Setup->Shares->Settings

Set workgroup to HOME

19.) Enable firewall (after allowing things through)

    sudo ufw allow ssh
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port domain
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port http
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port https
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port bootps
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-ns
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-dgm
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port netbios-ssn
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port microsoft-ds
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port mdns

- enable:

    sudo ufw enable

20.) cups
- sudo system-config-printer
- add printers as appropriate
- Under Server->Settings select:
    Show printers shared by other systems
- For servers, under "Server Settings", select:
    Publish shared printers conected to this system
- make sure to enable it in the ufw
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port ipp

21.) Set up hpodder (installed above)

crontab -e

then make it look like:

  0 6   *   *   *    /home/matt/bin/hpodder > /dev/null

so it will run every morning at 6am and log to nowhere

22.) Set up email backups (amahi only)

sudo apt-get install offlineimap

crontab -e

then add:

@hourly              offlineimap -u quiet

so it will sync email hourly

Of course, this is only half of it - it snapshots email, but doesn't
really do an archive. For that, we do an rsnapshot

sudo apt-get install rsnapshot

and then set up crontab:

#0 */1  * * *  /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /home/matt/.rsnapshot_email.conf hourly
#30 3   * * *  /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /home/matt/.rsnapshot_email.conf daily
#0  3   * * 1  /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /home/matt/.rsnapshot_email.conf weekly
#30 2   1 * *  /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /home/matt/.rsnapshot_email.conf monthly

23.) Set up sensors:

- For amahi / ASROCK E350
- add the following to /etc/modules:
w83627ehf

24.) Make ssh work:
## For an old machine, use the old keys - you did save /etc, didn't you?

## For a new machine, use the new keys generated by the distro.

- make sure to add to the firewall
ufw allow ssh

- set:
- PermitRootLogin no

- once you've set up public key auth, turn off password access. edit
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and set
    PasswordAuthentication no

service ssh restart

25.) Set up ntpd server:

- enable firewall

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port ntp

26.) Set up ssmtp
    cd /etc/ssmtp
    mv ssmtp.conf ssmtp.conf.old
    cp ~/system_stuff/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf .
    chmod a+r ssmtp.conf

27.) Set up logcheck
- edit /etc/cron.d/logcheck and set it to @daily and not every 2 hours

28.) Fix wake on lan:

cd /usr/bin
sudo ln -s wakeonlan wol

29.) Add database backup to crontab:

@daily               /home/matt/bin/mysql_backup > /dev/null

(make sure the DB password is in ~/attic/backup/amahi/mysql.pw

30.) Add fstab line for external backup drive (because there's no
     automounter)

/dev/sde1          /mnt/external_backup  ext4   defaults,noauto  0       0

- Make sure to make the mountpoint:

sudo mkdir /mnt/external_backup

31.) Add UPS monitoring

- From:

http://blog.shadypixel.com/monitoring-a-ups-with-nut-on-debian-or-ubuntu-linux/

- The first bit, with GNOME, works for desktops, not server. Anyway,
  install things:

sudo apt-get install nut

- Edit /etc/nut/ups.conf

[apc]
    driver = usbhid-ups
    port = auto

- There's only one UPS hooked to this guy, so we don't need to worry
  about disambiguation.

- Also, if you just installed nut, but the UPS is already plugged in,
  you'll need to unplug and replug it to fire the notplug events.

- Start it:

sudo upsdrvctl start

- Add the following to /etc/nut/upsd.conf

ACL all 0.0.0.0/0
ACL localhost 127.0.0.1/32
ACCEPT localhost
REJECT all

- This will reject all nonlocal traffic

- Add the following to /etc/nut/upsd.users

[local_mon]
    password = PASSWORD_HERE
    allowfrom = localhost
    upsmon master

- Obviously, make PASSWORD_HERE some random password

- Add the following to /etc/nut/upsmon.conf, at the bottom of the
  MONITOR section:

MONITOR ups@localhost 1 local_mon PASSWORD_HERE master

- Edit /etc/nut/nut.conf and set

MODE=standalone

- Start it

sudo service nut start

- You can print statistics via:

upsc ups

32.) Set up nightly monitoring

- add the following to crontab

@daily               /usr/bin/ntpq -p; echo; df -lh; echo; cat /proc/mdstat

II. Install and configure apps:

(This may require going to the store and buying the non-free ones, etc.)

1.) DLNA

(From: https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/DLNA)

- In Setup->Shares, add:

   dlna     /var/hda/files/dlna

- And we want them to be guest writeable, so add the "extra parameter":

guest ok = yes

- Make the missing remount lines:

     sudo mkdir /home/matt/dlna
     sudo mkdir /home/liz/dlna

- Add remount lines:

/mnt/dlna          /var/hda/files/dlna   none   bind             0       0
/mnt/dlna          /home/matt/dlna/      none   bind             0       0
/mnt/dlna          /home/liz/dlna/       none   bind             0       0

- Then remount:

   sudo mount -a

- edit /etc/minidlna.conf

- comment out all the media_dir lines

- add this one:

   media_dir=/var/hda/files/dlna

- And we want guests to *actually* be able to write to it, so we need
  to fix those perms:

sudo chmod o+w /var/hda/files/dlna

- But we don't want random users deleting things, so set the sticky
  bit for a modicum of security:

sudo chmod +t /var/hda/files/dlna

- And we want the users group to be able to manipulate things:

sudo chmod g+s /var/hda/files/dlna

- restart:

   sudo /etc/init.d/minidlna restart

- Allow through firewall

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port 8200

2.) Amahi Time Machine

(From: https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_Time_Machine)

- add a remount line to fstab:

/mnt/time_machine  /var/hda/files/amahi-time-machine  none  bind 0       0

- Remount:

   sudo mount -a

- fix perms so Liz can write to it:

   sudo chown -R liz /mnt/time_machine/

- Allow through firewall

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.9.0/24 to any port 548

- Due to an odd bug (likely a race condition), these aren't always
  started in the correct order, and often need a kick to work:

https://bugs.amahi.org/issues/1045
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/avahi/+bug/624043?comments=all
http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1482573.html

- Anyway, add the following to /usr/local/bin/timemachine_restart:

#!/bin/sh
service avahi-daemon stop
service netatalk stop
sleep 5
service netatalk start
service avahi-daemon start

- fix perms:

sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/timemachine_restart

- and then edit root's crontab and add:

@reboot /usr/local/bin/timemachine_restart > /dev/null 2>&1

3.) OpenVPN

- Allow through firewall from everywhere:

sudo ufw allow openvpn

4.) DokuWiki

(Picked docuwiki after looking at the syntax examples in
http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/DokuWiki+PmWiki+WikkaWiki)

- Install it
- Add a webserver alias
   Apps->Webapps->dokuwiki
   Click New Alias
   Add wiki
- And a DNS alias:
   Networking->Aliases
   - add "wiki" going to IP 51
   - click "Create Alias"
- Add users through admin panel.
- Edit the local config:
 - Enable CamelCase
  - edit /var/hda/web-apps/dokuwiki/html/conf/local.php
  - add:
    $conf['camelcase']   = 1;
  - to the end
 - Change title to "Caron family wiki":
    $conf['title'] = 'Caron family wiki';
 - Show usernames:
  - add:
    $conf['showuseras']  = 'loginname';

5.) ownCloud
- Log in using default creds
- install pwauth

sudo apt-get install pwauth

- Click the "settings" gear at bottom left:
 - Click Apps
  - Enable Unix User Backend
  - Enable Bookmarks
  - Enable Tasks
 - Click Users
  - Delete the Admin account

- Thunderbird:
 - Address books
   http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/user_manual/pim/sync_thunderbird.html
   - Used URL:
     http://owncloud.home/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/matt/contacts
   - You can't copy cards, you need to export/import them
 - Calendar

TODO:

- Monitor stuff via SNP, etc.

 - Looks like this needs to be manual - the one for Amahi is beta and
   therefore unavailable to me:
 - OpenWRT monitoring via SNMP:
       http://www.roth.lu/s9y/index.php?/archives/45-Monitoring-OpenWRT-via-SNMP-using-Munin.html
 - Should definitely be able to do it w/ the main router - might work
   for the 54Gs as well.
 - Also:
       https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7167


- Consider stuff in Tomboy's AmahiApps page.

- Upgrade printer firmware and lock down

- Write out passwords, put in envelope in safe

IV. Backup scripts

To run a backup, insert the external drive in to the cradle and run:

    sudo ~/bin/server_backup

V. Notes
 -  /usr/bin/hdactl shows a lot of how things work
