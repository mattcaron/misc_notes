kdenlive dvdstyler

kdenlive - for video editing
dvdstyler - for menu creation and chaptering (kdenlive kind of sucks at this)

1. Add to video group:
sudo usermod -a -G video matt

2. dvgrab needs the -guid option to find the correct device because I
have multiple firewire ports. Pass it info as follows:

-guid 002011010100b160 
  ^ for Canopus ADVC 100


For DVDs:

In kdenlive:
  - Choose "render" and render to DVD (easy enough)
  - Then you import these files into dvdstyler

For general clips:

In Kdenlive:
  - Choose "render" and select "Lossless/HQ", and pick "H.264 lossless
    fast(video) + PCM(sound)."
  - Once rendered, you can use GHB to convert it to one of the predefined
    profiles.
  - I note that this is likely a higher quality output than most
    recording devices will output, but we can be reasonably assured
    that we're not making it worse. via the intermediary conversion.
