sudo apt-get install kino kdenlive dvdstyler

kino - all in one capture/edit/etc.
dvgrab - capture DV/HDV via firewire (CLI - use kino as a frontend)
kdenlive - for video editing (more featureful than Kino, and has some
           effects kino lacks, but doesn't do capturing)
	   - ### New version might do capturing. Need to check on that.
dvdstyler - for menu creation and chaptering (kdenlive kind of sucks at this)

1. Add to video group:
sudo usermod -a -G video matt

2. dvgrab needs the -guid option to find the correct device because I
have multiple firewire ports. Pass it info as follows:

dvgrab -guid 002011010100b160 
  ^ for Canopus ADVC 100

Kino doesn't need this (2, that is) but works with just (1), but, if
you want to have audio playback while capturing, you need to invoke it
with:

padsp kino

- May no longer be accurate in Ubuntu 16.04; not sure.

For DVDs:

In kdenlive:
  - Choose "render" and render to DVD (easy enough)
  - You may need to tick the box for "show all profiles" and select
    the one which you want to use (eg NTSC 16:9 or 4:3)
  - Then you import these files into dvdstyler

For general clips:

In Kdenlive:
  - Choose "render" and select "Lossless/HQ", and pick "FFV1 (ffv1 + flac)"
  - Once rendered, you can use GHB to convert it to one of the predefined
    profiles.
  - I note that this is likely a higher quality output than most
    recording devices will output, but we can be reasonably assured
    that we're not making it worse via the intermediary conversion.

For uploading to the world:

ghb is a converter to more broadly compatible formats.


If the video is flipped (180, such as from my phone), kdenlive has a
transform for that.
	  - Effects
	  - Crop and transform
	  - Rotate (keyframable)
	  - Drag it over the clip
	  - Click properties
	  - Rotate x by desired amount x 10 (so, 1800 for 180 degrees)
